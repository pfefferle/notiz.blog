<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two big changes in the new WP-APML version:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
	<li>Links and Feeds, are now part of the APML Feed. Sample: <a href="https://notiz.blog/apml/">https://notiz.blog/apml/</a></li>
	<li>You can search through my blog using your APML file and there is also a sidebar-widget with some meta-informations. Sample: <a href="https://notiz.blog/apml/search/?s=http://notsorelevant.com/wp-apml.php">https://notiz.blog/apml/search/?s=http://notsorelevant.com/wp-apml.php</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What do you think about it? Any ideas to make something better?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there are no more suggestions and if everythinks works fine, I would release it in the next few days.</p>

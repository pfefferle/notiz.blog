There are two big changes in the new WP-APML version:

<ul><li>Links and Feeds, are now part of the APML Feed. Sample: <a href="http://notiz.blog/apml/">http://notiz.blog/apml/</a></li>
<li>You can search through my blog using your APML file and there is also a sidebar-widget with some meta-informations. Sample: <a href="http://notiz.blog/apml/search/?s=http://notsorelevant.com/wp-apml.php">http://notiz.blog/apml/search/?s=http://notsorelevant.com/wp-apml.php</a></li></ul>

What do you think about it? Any ideas to make something better?

If there are no more suggestions and if everythinks works fine, I would release it in the next few days.

Dawn Foster schreibt auf <a href="https://gigaom.com/2011/07/08/the-indie-web-who-owns-your-identity/" title="The Indie Web: Who owns your identity?">Gigaom</a> über die <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/"><strong>Indie Web</strong></a>-Bewegung:

<blockquote>The Indie Web movement is primarily about ownership and control over your identity. The difficulty is that many of the tools that we need to achieve the complete vision of data ownership just don’t exist yet, or they exist, but not in a way that is accessible to most people. During IndieWebCamp, we focused on discussing these current issues and starting to build some of the tools necessary to make the Indie Web a reality for regular people.</blockquote>

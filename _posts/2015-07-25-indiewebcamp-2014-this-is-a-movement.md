Tantek Ã‡elik fasst in <a href="http://tantek.com/2015/201/b1/indiewebcamp-2014-year-review">einem Artikel</a> die Highlights der <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/">IndieWeb Bewegung</a> vom letztem Jahr zusammen:
<blockquote>2014 was a breakthrough year for IndieWebCamp and the IndieWeb movement. Beyond our technical achievements in creating, building, deploying, and using simple formats &amp; protocols on our personal sites, we organized record numbers of IndieWebCamps and Homebrew Website Club meetups. We gave talks to audiences of thousands, and the press started covering us in earnest. We saw the launch of Known and its hosted service Withknown, a user-friendly mobile-web ready solution for anyone to get on the indieweb.</blockquote>

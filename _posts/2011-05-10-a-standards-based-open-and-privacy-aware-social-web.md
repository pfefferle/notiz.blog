Das W3C Ã¼ber das "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/socialweb/XGR-socialweb-20101206/">Standards-based, Open and Privacy-aware Social Web</a>".

<blockquote>While the best known current social networking sites on the Web limit themselves to relationships between people with accounts on a single site, the Social Web should extend across the entire Web. Just as people can call each other no matter which telephone provider they belong to, just as email allows people to send messages to each other irrespective of their e-mail provider, and just as the Web allows links to any website, so the Social Web should allow people to create networks of relationships across the entire Web, while giving people the ability to control their own privacy and data.</blockquote>

First of all, the WP-APML plugin is now part of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/apml-library/">APML-Library</a> and can be downloaded from the <a href="http://apml-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wordpress/">APML SVN</a>.

There is now also a script for older WordPress versions available. This first version only supports categories to APML, but I want to support <a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/"><abbr title="Ultimate Tag Warrior">UTW</abbr> 3</a> and <a href="http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/plugins/simple-tagging/">Simple-Tagging</a> soon. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to write a comment.
